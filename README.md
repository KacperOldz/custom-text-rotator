# Elementor Text Rotator Widget

- **Easy Integration:** Simply add the custom section to your Elementor layout to incorporate the text rotation functionality.
- **Customizable Design:** Easily modify the appearance of the text container through the Elementor editor or customize the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
